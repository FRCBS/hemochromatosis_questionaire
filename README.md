Koskinen, Elina: Blood donors’ perceptions of receiving genetic results from Blood Service Biobank
## linkki tähän

## Abstract:
As the use of genetic information becomes more common in healthcare, it is important to understand how citizens perceive genetic information about themselves and its reception. Genetic data is returned to biobanks through various research projects. The return of genetic data raises ethical questions about what should be returned to the study subjects, how it should be done, and by whom.

This master’s thesis was part of a pilot study conducted at the Finnish Red Cross Blood Service. In the pilot study, information about genetic predisposition to haemochromatosis (iron-overload disease) was returned to the members of Blood Service Biobank in the fall of 2023. This is the first time in Finland that genetic information was returned to biobank members based on the biobank consent.

The purpose of this study was to describe blood donors’ perceptions of the return of genetic information. The aim was to provide information on how blood donors respond to genetic findings they receive. The research question was: What kind of experience do blood donors have on receiving genetic results concerning their risk for haemochromatosis? Surveys were sent in March 2024 to 56 blood donors who are members of Blood Service Biobank, who did not know their predisposition to haemochromatosis before the pilot study. Thirty-eight responses were received by January 2025. The data was analysed descriptively.

Blood donors’ perceptions about receiving genetic information from Blood Service Biobank were mainly positive. The information was seen useful. Blood donors thought they would like to receive similar information in the future, and that the information in biobanks should be used more to promote health. Respondents’ confidence in Blood Service and their willingness to belong to Blood Service Biobank grew. Of the participants, 37% (N=14) were diagnosed with haemochromatosis (ICD-10: E83.1) after they applied to healthcare due to the information received.

The results of this study were similar to previous research, also with the cancer-causing variants. People are curious to know more about their health. It is important to discuss what to do with the genetic information in biobanks and how to handle it ethically and sustainably. Hearing blood donors’ perceptions and opinions is essential, so their experience is acknowledged and better understood. Raising knowledge among the public is important. The nursing staff's knowledge of the usage of genetic data in healthcare must also be increased to ensure that nurses have the competence to engage with and support patients.
